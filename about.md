## Who I am and what I do ##

I'm a developer based in Kent, United Kingdom, and am passionate about development, particularly web development.

I've been working as a developer since 2008, with my journey starting with ASP.Net Web Forms and VB.Net, and moved onto MVC patterns and C# shortly after, after discovering ASP.Net MVC was closer aligned to my philosophy on web development.
Horses for courses and all that, but when MVC3 was released, it really felt right for me. I could rant on but I won't, ASP.Net MVC allows me to create clean, concise code and has never got in my way, which I can't say for Web Forms.

I keep private work to an absolute minimum now, as allowing my brain to recharge outside of work hours pays dividends in both my career and my social life.

My portfolio is available on my (currently outdated!) [personal website](http://www.steveonthefly.co.uk/).
